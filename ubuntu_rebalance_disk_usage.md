The code rebalances disk space by:

1. Moving large data directories (/home/jonc/Downloads and /home/jonc/Documents) from the 93% full drive (/dev/nvme1n1p2) to the 13% used drive (/dev/nvme0n1p1)

2. Process:
   - Mounts second drive to /mnt/temp
   - Uses rsync to copy directories to new location
   - Deletes original directories 
   - Creates symbolic links pointing to new locations
   - Updates /etc/fstab for persistence

3. Result:
   - Data physically stored on less-used drive
   - Applications/users still access files through original paths
   - First drive usage decreases by size of moved directories
   - Second drive usage increases but has ample space

Would you like me to explain the technical implementation of any specific step?
